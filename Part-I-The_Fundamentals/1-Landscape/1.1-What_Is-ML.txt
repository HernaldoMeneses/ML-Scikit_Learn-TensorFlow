Whats is Machine Learning?
    Science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.
Why Use Machine Learning?
    Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules:
        one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.
    Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional aproach:
        the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
    Fluctuating environments:
        a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
    Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.
